This project will investigate new approaches to modelling, designing and generating mobile eHealth apps for phones and wearables. The approach will include eHealth "living lab"; behavioural requirements capture; emotional requirements capture; domain-specific visual language-based generator; user- and AI-based app configuration; and proactive user feedback loop. We will start with an SLR of current mobile eHealth app development processes and tools, design and prototype parts of the previously proposed solution set, and evaluate with a range of real-world health apps and target end users.

Furthermore, for mobile health apps, it is likely that there will be several versions of those apps that are developed for different mobile devices such as wearables and smartphones. This project will attempt to collect a set of such apps and look into the problem from the software product lineâ€™s point of view, e.g., to learn from those apps to eventually design and implement platforms for helping developers to better implement their mobile health apps (e.g., device-specific configurations).  This project is related to our ARC Hub in Digital Enhanced Living project.
