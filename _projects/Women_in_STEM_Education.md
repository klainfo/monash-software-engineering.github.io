We are seeking a PhD student at Monash University on investigating software engineering education for teenagers, especially for female STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) students.

This project is a part of an exciting collaboration with Monash Tech School, Victorian Space, Science Education Centre, micro:bit, Tech Girls Movement, Hacker Exchange and Monash Generator to develop and nurture an entrepreneurial mindset in the next generation of women in the Internet of Things (IOT). We are trying to organize hundreds of teenage girls to learn the concepts of IOT by developing software programs using the hands-on micro:bit devices. This project will explore that how to enhance girls’ learning experience about STEM and how such learning experience can contribute to their future entrepreneurial potential.

Apart from the quantitative analysis of students’ code, we will also carry out the qualitative analysis of their behaviour and learning experience. We will further investigate the longitudinal impact of this project to the future of these students. Based on the mined insights, we will develop tools to assist students especially teenagers with learning programming and entrepreneurial mindset.
