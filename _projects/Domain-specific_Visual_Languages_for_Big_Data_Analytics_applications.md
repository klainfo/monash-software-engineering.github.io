This PhD project will investigate the development of a set of design principles for domain-specific visual languages (DSVLs) to be applied to modelling big data analytics applications. This will include: reviewing and enhancing existing design principles for DSVLs; using these principles to identify visual metaphors for target end users of data analytics application specifications; prototyping DSVL-based tools to specify and generate these applications; and testing and refining these designs on several representative big data analytics application domains. This project is a part of an ARC Discovery project that aims to build DSVLs to be used in big data analytics applications.
